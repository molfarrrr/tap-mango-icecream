## Notes

As of 06-07-2025 NgRx is at version 19. Installing that on top of the Angular v20 required `--force` flag. Use `npm i --force` when installing packages for this project.

## The Challenge

You have been tasked with **designing and developing a clean, modern web application** for a
client who owns an ice cream store. The application will serve as an **inventory management
system** tailored specifically for their business needs. It should allow the store owner to
efficiently add, update, and remove ice cream products from their inventory list.


In addition to basic inventory management, the app should feature a **dashboard** that provides
key insights into product performance. This includes highlighting best-selling items/flavors and
notifying the owner of items that are low in stock, enabling smarter restocking decisions and
overall better product oversight.

## Your Task

Build an **Angular** application:

1. **Product Management Interface**
    1. List view of current products with essential details
    2. Ability to add, edit or delete products
2. **Inventory Dashboard**
    1. Visuals like charts, badges, or cards to show
        1. Whatâ€™s selling the most
        2. When stock is running low

## Deliverables

1. A functioning **Angular application** that allows you manage the inventory and view performance of products.
2. **Screenshots** of
    1. Product Management Interface
    2. Inventory Dashboard
