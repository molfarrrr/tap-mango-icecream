# TapMangoIcecream

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.5.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Notes

As of 06-07-2025 NgRx is at version 19. Installing that on top of the Angular v20 required `--force` flag. Use `npm i --force` when installing packages for this project.

## The Challenge

You have been tasked with **designing and developing a clean, modern web application** for a
client who owns an ice cream store. The application will serve as an **inventory management
system** tailored specifically for their business needs. It should allow the store owner to
efficiently add, update, and remove ice cream products from their inventory list.


In addition to basic inventory management, the app should feature a **dashboard** that provides
key insights into product performance. This includes highlighting best-selling items/flavors and
notifying the owner of items that are low in stock, enabling smarter restocking decisions and
overall better product oversight.

## Your Task

Build an **Angular** application:

1. **Product Management Interface**
   1. List view of current products with essential details
   2. Ability to add, edit or delete products
2. **Inventory Dashboard**
   1. Visuals like charts, badges, or cards to show
      1. Whatâ€™s selling the most
      2. When stock is running low

## Deliverables

1. A functioning **Angular application** that allows you manage the inventory and view performance of products.
2. **Screenshots** of
   1. Product Management Interface
   2. Inventory Dashboard
